\title{Vigil: Cross-Platform File System Watching for R}
\description{
Provides a unified interface for file system watching across Windows and Unix-like
systems. Supports pattern matching, custom callbacks, and persistent watchers.

Platform-specific requirements:
\itemize{
\item Windows: taskscheduleR package (only for persistent watchers)
\item Linux: inotify-tools
\item macOS: fswatch
}
}
\section{Platform-Specific Features}{

Different platforms use different mechanisms for file watching:
\itemize{
\item Windows uses FileSystemWatcher through VBScript, and Task Scheduler (via taskscheduleR)
for persistent watchers
\item Linux uses inotify-tools for file watching and systemd for persistent watchers
\item macOS uses fswatch for file watching and launchd for persistent watchers
}
}
